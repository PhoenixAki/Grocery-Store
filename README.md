# Grocery-Store
## Purpose
This was a fun project assignment for a Data Structures class in Fall 2016. The goal was to simulate a grocery store that has customers entering at random intervals with random service times, and logically determine which lane to place each customer into to minimize the overall wait time in all 3 lanes.
## How to Run
Simply compile **Customer.hpp, Customer.cpp, Lane.hpp, Lane.cpp, and Main.cpp** using a standard C++ compiler like G++, and run the output .exe file :)
